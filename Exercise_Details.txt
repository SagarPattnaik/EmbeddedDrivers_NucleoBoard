USE HSE Clock as input clock source

HSE clock is supplied by STLINK circuitry through MCO output pin which is coming from PIN PA8
PA8 (STLINK)-> OSC_IN (STM32F446RE) 

Using HSE Configure the SYSCLK as 8MHz
AHB clock as 4MHz (HCLK)
APB1 clock as 2MHz (PCLK1)
APB2 clock as 2MHz (PCLK2)

Clock Source-> HSE 8MHz-> SYSCLK 8MHz-> AHB prescaler 2-> HCLK 4MHz -> APB1 prescaler 2 -> 2MHz
                                                                    -> APB2 prescaler 2 -> 2MHz
